                DEFINING THE PREJUDICE

            <p1>
                Social tendency towards, intolerance, negativity and stigmatization of that which we do not understand results in a highly inhibited LGBT+ population. The result of this, for victims of society’s judgement is to conceal themselves, to stay in the closet, "blend in" and/or "overcome" their sexuality. The effect of this has consequences for not only the LGBT+ individuals, but as well to the people around them, especially people in the community.

                <br>
                Simply put, and using a recently created term, “internalised homophobia,” occurs when LGBT+ individuals are subjected to society’s prejudices, and the result turns those negative feelings and ideas inward, believing they are true.
                <br>
                The problem leading this, is that someone insecure with him or herself will not be comfortable in the world around them.

                Descriptions like "no fats; no femmes; no Asians; no blacks; masc only; my age or younger; str8-acting, you be too; non-scene; etc" started coming into view when apps like Grindr emerged. Do the social function of these apps bring to light some inherent, dark quality within the community that was  kept hidden through isolation? Internal stereotyping, rejection and discrimination are unfortunately the result.

                This sort of language insults gay, racial minorities, men of different ages, men who express their sexuality in non-traditional ways apart from “normal” heteromasculine ideals. This includes men and women who are proud of being gay, those who celebrate what the community has achieved in less than 50 years, those suffering from HIV, individuals who enjoy sex with people of the same sex, men and women who do not conform to heteronormative demands for monogamy and people who don't like being told by an oppressive over-class how they should or should not live their lives.

                CASE STUDY
                </div>
                <br>
                Taking a look at current events reveals the devastation of internalised homophobia in real time. In the summer of 2016, Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old security guard, killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in a terrorist attack inside Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, United States. It is suspected that Mateen was in fact, gay and suffered from internalized homophobia, leading him to react violently.
                <br><br>
                Analysing this event makes evident that the personal and the political are inextricably intertwined. When we see this ‘homophobic mass-murderer’ as a tormented, self-hating gay person, motivated by the homophobia he had internalised, we consider the atrocity from a psychological perspective. However, actions, attitudes and beliefs do not arise out of a vacuum; if Mateen had indeed suffered from internalized homophobia then there must have been some external event leading him to internalise in the first place. It is in fact, the external homophobia that lends itself to the political analysis and the call for political action and reform. If he did have homoerotic feelings, then what role did Mateen’s religious education have in bringing about this tragic event? What was he taught as a child and throughout his life about homosexuality, and what effect did this have on his capacity to develop as a balanced, happy, self-accepting, self-loving individual, with a sense of sexuality that was well-integrated into a healthy psyche?
                <br><br>
                <div class="c">
                The political will always impact the psychological, and indeed, the political only ever has any meaning insofar as it aims to promote the psychological well-being of humanity.

                What can we do in terms of political action, to raise consciousness about the harm caused by homophobic attitudes, and especially those indoctrinated into children by adherents of extremely homophobic religious beliefs?

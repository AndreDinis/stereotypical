                <p>Stereotypical is aimed to raise issue with and start a discussion on the injustice within the LGBT+ community. The problem of demeaning the very own it serves to protect, via harsh and critical language.</p>
                
                <p1>The concept of internalised homophobia reffers to negative, distressing thoughts and feelings experienced by lesbians and gay men about their sexuality, and which are attributed to experiences of cultural heterosexism and victimisation. Many individuals within lesbian and gay communities internalise significant aspects of the prejudice experienced within a heterosexist society.

                  <br> <br>
                <p2>This way of thinking is the beginning of a series of problems related to stereotyping within the LGBT+ community. There is a fundamental issue if one cannot express their sexual preference without insulting other non-heterosexuals, requiring a change to be made. All of us have suffered in some way from the violence, humiliation, ridicule, and shattering shame thrown by a heteronormative society and perpetuated against non-heterosexual people. Because of this, it is confusing as to why anyone who has suffered similarly, would put down their own community for being their own individual.
                </p2>
                <p3>This is a massive problem that keeps on being overlooked. However, we can begin to agree that it definitely has impact in the rest of the society and that is why we will explore the issues, and try to find a solution to solve those.

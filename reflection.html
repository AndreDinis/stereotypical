                A gay men’s homophobia may sound oxymoronic, but it is increasingly apparent in a culture that praises masculinity and derides femininity. One can see this effect when gay men who conform to stereotypes, like the ‘worshipping’ of pop icons like Beyoncé, quoting American drag queen RuPaul or dressing in flamboyant style are met with a wince or said to be a let down to the community. 
                <br><br>
                Increasingly, it appears that the divide is no longer between heterosexuals and homosexuals, but truly gay men who separate into ‘camp’ and ‘straight-acting’, terms that imply a degree of posturing.<br><br>

                Irrevocably, it is evident that the gay person’s direction of negative social attitudes and devaluation of the self results in internal conflicts and poor self-regard.
                Locke wrote that the socio-political state we live in is the cause of 'the self-hatred that occurs as a result of being a socially stigmatized person.'.

                Is it possible to change one's mind?
                Yes. Of course.

                If you look at this sentence. Or actually, just look at this word. See how quickly you recognise it? It's so fast you can't even register how fast that recognition took. In fact, with most common words, it's now impossible for one not to read them. The brain translates them as soon as the eyes register that the word exists. That's because the brain has programmed itself to read and recognise words.

                This is what it is like to normalise homosexuality. It is a slow process that builds until one day, you realise that you don't feel awkward about it anymore. It becomes natural.
